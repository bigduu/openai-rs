# OpenAI-RS Project Overview

This is a Rust-based intelligent streaming proxy system for LLM APIs with enhancement capabilities. The project follows a clean architecture pattern with multiple layers.

## Key Files
- [Cargo.toml](mdc:Cargo.toml) - Main workspace and dependency configuration
- [artitacture.md](mdc:artitacture.md) - Detailed architecture documentation

## Core Crates
- [binary/](mdc:binary) - Application binaries and entry points
- [interface/](mdc:interface) - API interfaces and HTTP handlers
- [app/](mdc:app) - Application business logic
- [domain/](mdc:domain) - Core domain models and traits
- [infra/](mdc:infra) - Infrastructure implementations

The project is designed as a streaming proxy that can enhance, modify, and process LLM API responses in real-time, with support for multiple LLM providers and extensible processing capabilities.
